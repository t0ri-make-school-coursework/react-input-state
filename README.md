# Lifting State in Input Tags within React
Each branch is another step in the process.

## Branches
### 1
Branch 1 is the creation of the components required, `InputForm` and `InputText`.  These components, and `App.js`, are completely stateless.

### 2
Branch 2 adds binding inside of the constructor and adds the `setState` handler.

### 3
Branch 3 links the components together by adding onChange attributes to the JSX.
